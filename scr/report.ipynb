    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will make hourly prediction of taxi demand in the Bronx, and determine the optimal number of taxis required accordingly. The data at hand is the historical trip data from taxis, combined with hourly weather data. The potential challenges and oppertunites of this analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* data quality: \n",
    "  \n",
    "  the data need to be cleaned and processed to remove bias arising from technical errors and outliers of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* data smoothing:\n",
    "\n",
    "  the original time series of hourly demand can be noisy for trend and seasonality recognition. The occational zero value of hourly demand around mid-night can also be problematic for the analysis. Therefore, data smoothing is necessary prior to modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* seasonality:\n",
    "\n",
    "  The taxi demand is subject to, but not limited to, the followings seasonalities: \n",
    "  * hour of the day: the taxi demand would surge during rush-hours.\n",
    "  * day of the week: Friday night, Saturday and Sunday are more likely to yield higher demands than workdays. \n",
    "  * week of the month: The bi-weekly payroll days in United States are typically the first and 15/16th days of each month according to Forbes. Thus the first and third week can potentially have surging demand. However, this hypothesis need to be tested with the data. \n",
    "  * public holidays: We can encode all public holidays in the data in 2023 and test its importance in the prediction models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Note that to consider the potential impact of multiple seasonalities, we need to perform transformation to decompose the taxi demands time-series to its trend, seasonality and residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* spatial factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "  The spatial patterns in the taxi trip records may be helpful for taxi demand prediction. Specifcally, a surging number of drop-offs in the same borough may indicate that there is an event, and therefore impact the future taxi demand hours later. For example, if there are lots of drop-offs in Bronx or a neighoring borough at 9pm, it could be the cause of a concert at Bronx and it will lead to taxi demand surge in Bronx hours after the event. Therefore we need to encode the spatial factors of the drop-off locations and examine the impact of such features in our prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Crowd effects:\n",

    "  Similar to the spatial information, the abnormalty of the number of passengers in the taxi may indicate fluctutation of taxi demands hours later. e.g. group-trip for concerts. Therefore, we need to encode this information for predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Data summary\n",
    "\n",
    "  The original TaxiTrip data contains 66,000 rows or records. The columns include: tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime,  passenger_count,  trip_distance, \n",
    "  PULocationID, and DOLocationID.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* duplications\n",

    "\n",
    "  5752 passenger_count entries and 38 trip_distance entries are missing values. we replace the missing value with the median value of the column with same pick-up and drop-off locationsIDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zero values\n",
    "\n",
    "  13,369 trip-distances are zero. 2,685 records are with exact the same pick-up and drop-off date-time. We remove these 2,685 rows. For the rest of zero entries, we replace the zero trip-distances values with the median value of the subset trips data with the same pick-up and drop-off locations. Note that the high number of zero values implies that the original recorded trip distances may not be a reliable measurement of the trip information.\n",
    "\n",
    "  294 passenger_count have zero values. Assuming this ride-hailing company did not mix delivery service records with ride-hailing records, we will replace the 0 values with the median non-zero value.\n",

    "* Outlier values\n",
    "\n",
    "  We examine the summary statistics of each numerical column and find outliers in passenger_count and trip_distance.\n",
    "  There are 6 outliers in passenger_count values. i.e. we have 6 records of which each contains 11 passengers in a taxi. we replace these passenger_count with the median value of the column.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are also extremely outlier values of trip_distances (See Figure 1). The New York City has an area of 300.5 square-miles, therefore the theoretical maximum distances of a single drop-off in the NYC area should be sqrt(2)*sqrt(300.5) = 24.51 miles. However, consider that (i) there could be multiple drop-offs of multiple passengers in a single trip, and (ii) there were drop-offs outside of NYC, then the actual trip distances could be exceeding that limits. Therefore, instead we calculate the trip durations of each trip record, and calculate the expected trip_distances with the general speed limit of NYC, i.e. 25 mph. Specifically, for each suspicious outlier trip_distances (> 24.51 mile), we replace the recorded trip distance value with the lesser of these two values: (i) 25 mph times the recorded trip_durations for this trip and (ii) the original record trip_distance value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* trip durations\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Note we calculate the trip_durations from the pick-up date-time and drop-off date-time. There were 13 rows with pickup time later than drop-off time. Without proper hypothesis we will remove these 13 rows. There were also extremely long trip_durations (e.g. 3556 minutes = 59 hours). According to NYC government, \"Both taxi and FHV drivers are prohibited from transporting passengers for more than 10 hours in any 24-hour period\". Therefore we will remove all records that with trip_duration exceeding that limits. \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "  * At least 75% of trips have only one passenger.\n",
    "  * The median trip distance is 4.9 miles. 75% of trips have trip distance < 10.1 miles.\n",
    "  * The median trip duration is 27 minutes. 75% of trips have trip duration <= 43 minutes. Note that we will use this information later for calculating the optimal number of taxi deployment.\n",

The heatmap of hour-of-day and day-of-week shows a clear pattern of higher demand from 8am to 11am on Tuesday to Friday, with a minor outlier at 9pm on Saturday night. This could indicate the demand in Bronx are largely driven by the the work commute. The heatmap of day-of-week and week-of-month shows a clear parttern of higher demand at the first 2 weeks, which could be due to the payroll schedules and its first month effect on consumer behavior (Justine, 2010). \n",

The boxplot shows the interesting fact that the holidays have significantly lower demands, which supports the hypothesis that the Bronx taxi demand are largely driven by the work commute. We also observed a signficant negative correlations between temperature and demand, though the relationship can also be seen as nonlinear.  A significant positive correlation between precipitation and demand are also observed. Note that the rain volumn and precipitation are highly corelated (p>0.99). Therefore we dropped the rain volumn as a feature. Finally, the snowfall is not significantly correlated with taxi demand even restricted to snow days (pval=0.33). Therefore we also remove the snowfall features from the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "The most intuitive modeling of the time-series demands is to use the previous houly demands to predict the future demand. Considering the strong cyclical nature of houly taxi demand, we adop the weighted moving average model as the baseline model for this task. Note that we prefer weighted moving average over simple moving average because of the assumption that taxi demand at a specific time t is more likely to be close to the demand at t-1 than that from a more distant timestamp. \n",

    "  * (i) it is more sensitive to larger percentage errors, therefore ideal to evaluate model performance during low-demand periods in order to reduce operational cost of idle vehicles; \n",
    "  * (ii) the Bronx data here has no apparent outlier demand values, i.e. the high demand period data are reliable. Therefore the sensitivity of MAPE to larger percentage error is a desirable property to favor models with accuate predictions of the high demand and thus high revenue periods;  \n",
    "  * (iii) it is widely accepted in the literature of traffic predictions for the reasons listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided the best baseline model is WMA with window size equals to 2, after manually tunning of the chocie of window size to achieve best MAPE values on the complete data. The final WMA model achieved the MAPE with 0.18 as below. We will use this result as baseline to improve our prediction models."

    "    * Fourier transformation is a widely accepted method to model cyclical patterns and nested seasonalities, of which the frequency can be incorporated into machine learning algorithm as predictive features in comman practise. \n",
    "    * Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) can also be used to capture long-term trends and seasonal cycles.\n",
    "    * Holt-Winters' Seasonal method is also suitable for our analysis since it captures the stable seasonlaities with fixed periods (e.g. hour, day, week). \n",

    "\n",
    "  * It allow more flexible weighting strategy for the utilization of the lagged features. In fact, WMA assigns the historical taxi demand at t-1, t-2..t-N  a weight vector with fixed values (e.g. N,N-1,..1) for predicting taxi demand at time-point t. In contrast, machine learning algorithms can incorporate historical taxi demand as input features and obtain data-driven estimations of the weight vector to understand time dependencies.\n",

Note that HW method has three parameters alpha, beta and gamma, which controlls different levels of smoothing on level, trend and seasonality. We use cross-validation to tune the parameter values for each one of the two seasonlities: daily and weekly.

Even though we can manually curate some features such as temperature and precipitation, day-of-the-week ,...etc, however, these features are of zero importance for XGboost predictions. In fact, the xgboost model are major driven by the seasonal and trend features of demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will use the predicted taxi demand of frist week of September 2023 to forecast the First Week of September 2024. The assumption is that the factors of multiple seasonality and trend has major impact of taxi demands, and this assumption is supported by our best model.\n",

    "In order to determine the optimal number of taxis required to meet the predicted hourly demand in the Bronx, I will make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * the houly average trip durations in the first week, September 2023 is a reliable indicator of that in first week, September 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The taxi are constantly avaiable during the hour between trips. i.e. the Taxi drivers are constantly on duty when deployed. The pick-up time for taxi driver to get back to Bronx for the next request can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Oversupply: If the taxi supply is over the true demand, then the idle driver will lead to operational cost. The minimum wage at NYC is 15 dollar per hour, while a recent NYC law have required companies to pay delivery workers 17.96 an hour. In our calculation, we will use a=17.96 hourly pay as the baseline idle cost.i.e. Every hour every idle taxi driver will generate extra $17.96 operational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * undersupply: If the taxi supply is under the true demand, then the cost is (i) revenue oppertunity cost, which we will assume to be 19.62 per-trip according to a NYC article (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/nyregion/taxi-fare-hike-nyc.html); plus (ii) customer wait times will increase, leading to dissatisfaction. it will bring future potential revenue lost if the customers seek service from a competitor or public transportaion. Given this, I would make assumption that a high percentage of customers, specifically 80% would drop-off the demand pool. i.e. if the surplus of taxi demands are not met in this hour, then only 0.2 of the surplus demands last hour will be added to the demand pool of the next hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We conduct simulation analysis by simulating different values of taxi supplies: S. i.e. the number of Taxis deployed. For each value of S ranging from 10 to 100, we will calculate the expected total revenue for the first week, September, 2024. Specifically, the calculation goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For the first hour, let D=the number of demands, TD = the avearge trip durations (minutes) of this hour, S = supply of taxi.\n",
    "  * If S * 60 >= D * TD, then the revenue of this hour is D * 19.62 - (S * 60 - D * TD ) * ( 17.96/60 ), i.e. income - idle driver cost.\n",
    "  * If S * 60 < D * TD, then the revenue of this hour is 19.62 * ( S * 60 / TD ).  Update the next hour demand by D = D + 0.2 *(D - S * 60 /TD). Note that we recognize this approach may result in fractional demand for the next hour. However, we expect that, by the law of large numbers, the approximate distribution will converge to the true demand distribution over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of taxi supply is 19 for first week of September, 2024. Correspondingly, the expected total revenue is $25057.32 before expenses and deductions. The figure below shows the relationship between the total revenue and supply of taxi.\n",
